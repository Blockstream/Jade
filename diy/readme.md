# WARNING
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FLASH DIY FIRMWARE TO OFFICIAL BLOCKSTREAM JADE HW UNITS

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FLASH OFFICIAL BLOCKSTREAM FIRMWARE TO YOUR DIY HARDWARE

# Hardware Selection
There are a number of hardware devices that can run Jade firmware with minimal configuration by simply following the build guide in the main readme.

## No-Camera Hardware Options:

### TTGO (Lilygo) T-Display

# Modifying Configuration Files for Use
Once you are familiar with the process of flashing the firmware using the sdkconfig templates that are included in the /config folder of this repository, there are some additional changes that you should make to these files before using the device with actual funds. You can find example of suggested configuration files for both "nodebug" and "secureboot" the "diy" folder of this repository.

## Disabling Debug Features
If editing the default development configuration template...

You can find suggested configuration templates for various hardware in the "diy" folder of this repository.

**Add**

`CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL_NONE=y` 

**Remove** 

`CONFIG_DEBUG_MODE=y` 

## Enabling Secure Boot  
If you want to maximise the physical security of your device and prevent it from running firmware that you haven't signed with your signing key, you can enable Secure Boot.

You can find suggested configuration templates for various hardware in the "diy" folder of this repository. These are designed to mimic the settings found on a retail Jade device.

_Warning: Doing this cannot be un-done, nor can the signing key that the device will accept be changed._

[Read the official vendor documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/security/secure-boot-v2.html)

**Add**

    CONFIG_ESP32_DISABLE_BASIC_ROM_CONSOLE=y 
    CONFIG_SECURE_DISABLE_ROM_DL_MODE=y 
    CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_SIGNING_KEY=<PATH_TO_YOUR_SIGNING_KEY>
    CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT=y
    CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED=y
    CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_MODE_RELEASE=y
    CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN_3=y

_Depending on the hardare you have selected, you may need to remove the last line that requires a minimum of Rev3 hardware..._

**Remove**

`CONFIG_EFUSE_VIRTUAL=y`

# Disabling Bluetooth
If you would prefer to completely disable Bluetooth, you can also make the following modifications to your configuration template.

You can find suggested configuration templates for various hardware in the "diy" folder of this repository. These are designed to mimic the settings found on a retail Jade device. (For both no-debug and secure-boot templates)

**Add**

    CONFIG_APP_NO_BLOBS=y
    CONFIG_MBEDTLS_ECP_RESTARTABLE=y
    CONFIG_MBEDTLS_CMAC_C=y

**Remove**

    CONFIG_BT_ENABLED=y
    CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_ENABLED=y
    CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_MEM_ALLOC_MODE_EXTERNAL=y
    CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_MAX_CONNECTIONS=1
    # CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_ROLE_CENTRAL is not set
    # CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_ROLE_BROADCASTER is not set
    # CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_ROLE_OBSERVER is not set
    CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_NVS_PERSIST=y
    # CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_SM_LEGACY is not set
    CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_SVC_GAP_DEVICE_NAME="j"
    CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_GAP_DEVICE_NAME_MAX_LEN=11
    CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_ATT_PREFERRED_MTU=517
    CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_BLE_MAX_CONN=1
    # CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_FULL_SCAN_SUPPORTED is not set

# Upgrading firmware via OTA
If you have enabled secure boot with the settings suggested above you will need to do firmware updates via OTA.

An example command to do this using the jade.bin file in the /build folder would be:

`python jade_ota.py --noagent`
